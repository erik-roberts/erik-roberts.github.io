## About Me

As an anesthesiologist-scientist in training and tech enthusiast with a biomedical engineering and computational background, I am interested in leveraging perioperative clinical informatics and healthcare technology to improve patient care. Toward that end, graduate training provided me with skills in computational modeling, statistical learning, and signal processing.
